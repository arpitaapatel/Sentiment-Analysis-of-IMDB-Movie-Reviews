# Sentiment-Analysis-of-IMDB-Movie-Reviews

Sentiment analysis involves the computational identification and classification of opinions expressed in text to determine whether the sentiment conveyed is positive, negative, or neutral. It utilizes techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP) combined with deep learning to analyze and extract emotional tones and opinions effectively.

Example Use Case: Customer Feedback Analysis
One prominent application of sentiment analysis is in customer feedback evaluation. By analyzing reviews or comments from platforms like Twitter, Facebook, or product review websites, businesses can determine how their customers feel about their products or services. For instance:

Positive Feedback: "This product is outstanding! I highly recommend it."<br>
Negative Feedback: "Terrible quality. Completely disappointed."<br>
Classifying such feedback helps organizations identify areas of strength and improvement.
